Generators in Python are a type of iterator that allows you to create iterable sequences of values using a more memory-efficient and lazy evaluation approach. They are a powerful way to generate values on-the-fly without storing the entire sequence in memory. Generators are defined using functions with the yield keyword instead of the return keyword.

Here are the key concepts and benefits of generators:

Lazy Evaluation: Generators produce values one at a time, only when they are requested. This allows you to work with large datasets or infinite sequences without loading everything into memory at once.

Memory Efficiency: Since generators don't store the entire sequence in memory, they are memory-efficient and suitable for handling large datasets.

Syntax: Generators are created using functions with the yield keyword. When the function is called, it doesn't execute immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object, and the function's body is executed only when you iterate over the generator using a loop or other iterator methods.

Stateful: Generators can maintain internal state between successive iterations. The state is preserved between calls, which is not the case with normal functions.
